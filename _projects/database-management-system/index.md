description: Built a lightweight C++ DBMS skeleton with a tokenizer, command router, block storage layer, and tabular output views.
card_summary: A C++ database engine built as a system-design study. Tokenizer → command dispatcher → block storage → presentation, each layer separable and reasoned about in isolation. The project that taught me to think in layers before code.

## What It Does

This project is a database engine foundation: user commands are tokenized, routed through command handlers, executed against storage abstractions, and returned through view objects.

## Architecture

- `AppController` coordinates command routing, errors, and output.
- Tokenizer and scanner own lexical parsing so execution never manipulates raw strings.
- Chain-of-responsibility command processors make new commands easy to add.
- Block-oriented storage APIs prepare the engine for buffer pools, free-space maps, and logging.
- `View` and `TabularView` keep presentation separate from execution logic.

## Engineering Focus

- Designed for growth instead of one-off demo behavior.
- Kept interfaces small so parser, executor, storage, and output can evolve independently.
- Used script-level tests that exercise the same controller path as interactive CLI use.
